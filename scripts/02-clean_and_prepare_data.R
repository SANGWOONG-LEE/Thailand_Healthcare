# Pre-requisites: 
# - Need to have downloaded the DHS data and extract it using OCR and save it to inputs/data

#### Workspace setup ####
library(tidyverse)
library(pointblank)
# Read in the raw data. 
extracted_data <- read_csv("inputs/data/extracted_data.csv")

#### Data Cleaning ####

# Only keep useful columns by removing total percent column.
